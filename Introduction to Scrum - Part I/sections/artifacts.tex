	Scrum uses the following Artifacts to provide transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaption:
	\vspace{1em}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\setlength\itemsep{0.7em}
		\item Product Backlog
		\item Sprint Backlog
		\item Increment
	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Product Backlog}
	\begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{0.7em}
		\item Ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the Product
		\item Single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the Product
		\item It is dynamic
		\item It is never complete
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Product Backlog Refinement}
	\begin{block}{Key Concept}
		The act of adding \textbf{detail}, \textbf{estimates} and \textbf{order} to items in the Product Backlog
	\end{block}
	\vspace{0.5em}
	\begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{0.7em}
		\item The Product Owner and the Development Team cooperate during refinement
		\item The Scrum Team decides \textit{how} and \textit{when} refinement is done
		\item Usually consumes no more than 10\% of the team's capacity
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Sprint Backlog}
	\begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{0.7em}
		\item The set of Product Backlog Items to selected for the Sprint
		\item A plan for delivering the Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal
		\item Includes at least one high priority process improvement identified in the previous Retrospective meeting
	\end{itemize}
	\visible<2->{
		\vspace{1em}
		\begin{alertblock}{Important}
			The Sprint Backlog belongs solely to the Development Team and only they can change it during a Sprint
		\end{alertblock}
	}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Increment}
	\begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{0.7em}
		\item The sum of all Product Backlog Items completed during a Sprint and the value of Increments of all previous Sprints
		\item A step towards a vision or a goal
		\item Must be in usable condition regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to release it
	\end{itemize}
